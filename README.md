# Home Assistant Configuration

Here's my [Home Assistant[(https://home-assistant.io/) configuration. I run Home Assistant on a server with the following specs:
[ASRock B85M Pro4](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/335845/asrock-b85m-pro4.html)
[Intel Celeron G1840 Boxed](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/385832/intel-celeron-g1840-boxed.html)
[Crucial Ballistix Sport BLS2CP8G3D1609DS1S00CEU](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/315313/crucial-ballistix-sport-bls2cp8g3d1609ds1s00ceu.html)

[Xpenology[(https://xpenology.org/) Barebone.



I am currently running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on the NUC and used the [Docker[(https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/) approach to install HA.

I regularly update my configuration files. You can check my current HA version [here[(.HA_VERSION). If you like anything here, Be sure to :star2: my repo!
